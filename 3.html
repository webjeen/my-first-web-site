    <h2>AP Calculus AB</h2>
    <p>Advanced Placement (AP) Calculus (also known as AP Calc, Calc AB / Calc BC or simply AB / BC) is a set of two distinct Advanced Placement calculus courses and exams offered by the American nonprofit organization College Board. AP Calculus AB covers basic introductions to limits, derivatives, and integrals. AP Calculus BC covers all AP Calculus AB topics plus additional topics (including more advanced integration techniques such as integration by parts, Taylor series, parametric equations, vector calculus, polar coordinate functions, and curve interpolations).</p>
